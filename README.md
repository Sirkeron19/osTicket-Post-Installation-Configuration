# osTicket Post-Installation Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to configure osTicket after the initial installation.

## 1. Email Configuration

### 1.1 Configure SMTP for Outgoing Email
To send email notifications and responses through osTicket, configure the SMTP settings:
- Go to **Admin Panel > Settings > Email**.
- Set the **SMTP Server** (e.g., smtp.gmail.com for Gmail).
- Enter your **SMTP Port**, **Username**, and **Password**.
- Test the connection to ensure it's working.

### 1.2 Set Up Email Piping for Incoming Tickets
Configure osTicket to automatically create tickets from incoming emails:
- Set up an email address like `support@yourdomain.com`.
- Configure your email server to forward incoming emails to the osTicket pipe script (`/include/ost-queue.php`).

## 2. Department Setup

Departments are used to categorize and route tickets. You can create and configure them under:
- **Admin Panel > Manage > Departments**.
- Create new departments based on your support team structure (e.g., Sales, Technical Support, Billing).

## 3. Agent Setup

Agents are the users who manage and respond to tickets. Set them up under:
- **Admin Panel > Manage > Agents**.
- Create agent accounts and assign them to departments.

## 4. Theme and Branding

osTicket provides a default theme that can be customized. You can upload your own logo, change the ticket portal’s colors, or modify the overall look under:
- **Admin Panel > Settings > Themes**.

## 5. Security Enhancements

### 5.1 Change Default Admin Password
Always change the default password after the installation. To do this, go to:
- **Admin Panel > Manage > Admins**.
- Edit the admin account and change the password.

### 5.2 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
