# osTicket Post-Installation Configuration Steps

### 1.1 Configure SMTP for Outgoing Email
To send email notifications and responses through osTicket, configure the SMTP settings:

- Enter your **SMTP Port**, **Username**, and **Password**.
- Test the connection to ensure it's working.

### 1.2 Set Up Email Piping for Incoming Tickets
Configure osTicket to automatically create tickets from incoming emails:

- Configure your email server to forward incoming emails to the osTicket pipe script (`/include/ost-queue.php`).

## 2. Department Setup

Departments are used to categorize and route tickets. You can create and configure them under:
- **Admin Panel > Manage > Departments**.

- **Admin Panel > Settings > Themes**.

## 5. Security Enhancements

### 5.1 Change Default Admin Password
Always change the default password after the installation. To do this, go to:
